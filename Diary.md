- [play audio from terminal ](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/play-mp3-audio-raspberry-pi/)
- [play audio from terminal python](https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-play-audio-with-the-raspberry-pi/) (the sensor code runs from a python script, so this is probably the most elegant audio playback solution)
